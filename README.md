# Chess-Bot
My first C++ program

This is my first C++ program, I coded it in 2020. Compared to my previous projects, the code is clearly much cleaner, tho still lacking in both structure and commenting. Now as for the sources I used to understand the algorithm, I only used a single webpage (link below) wich was perfect for introducing me to "AI" while still giving me a challenge. The program includes both a PVP and PVE mode.
Now the program may be working fine, but the interface is fundamentally lacking all around. So I made a second version optimising and cleaning the code with QT wich is (or will be soon) on my github.
